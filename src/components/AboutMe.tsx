                    I’m a passionate game developer and web developer with over 10 years
                    of experience in fast-paced, high-volume environments. I’ve built
                    full games in Unity and Unreal Engine, and I specialize in creating
                    immersive and interactive user experiences. I’m always learning and
                    love solving complex problems.
