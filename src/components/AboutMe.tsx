                    For most of my career, I focused on videography and video editing—a field I truly enjoyed.
                    However, I discovered my true passion in game and web development and have since dedicated
                    myself to transitioning into this new path. Over the past four years, I’ve immersed myself
                    in learning and growing within this industry, and I love that every day brings new challenges
                    and opportunities to expand my skills.
