                "A rocketship platformer based on speed and movement mechanics. My first full released title available right now at Itch.io. My idea for this project was to develop a minimum viable product to start with, a simple game where you fly a rocket ship, then I wanted to see how far I could take that idea and how creative I could get with it. Every feature in the game was a new skill I was learning as I was going along. The result is a fun, goofy, creative, and addictive game. With an amazing soundtrack by the incredinly talented ForceFeeded.",

All involving cubes... As of now I have a few core features finished, but if I want to continue my game dev journey I will need to redirect my focus onto other projects for the time being.",
